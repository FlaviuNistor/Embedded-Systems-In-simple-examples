# Embedded-Systems-In-simple-examples
The example code for the laboratory descried in my book: Sisteme Incorporate In Exemple Simple, used in the Engineering University in Sibiu. The labs are based on the Microchip PIC16F690 device and the PicKit2 development board.  The code represents a working frame, but it is not complete. To make it complete, compliable and run it with success is your job.
